        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            What we have here is equal parts tuna and rice by weight, which for me, gives this the 
            perfect balance between protein and starch.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this may remind some people of a fried rice dish, this is significantly lighter, and 
            actually very low on the fat content, but that doesn't mean it's not satisfying, and like 
            most rice dishes, it's very comforting. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain rice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) jar tuna packed in olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely diced jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru), or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely sliced green onion, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour rice into a heavy pot and add water; swirl to allow rice to settle. Bring to a 
                simmer over medium-high heat; do not stir. Reduce heat to low, cover, and continue to 
                simmer for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While rice is cooking, place tuna into a large mixing bowl and break up with your hands 
                or a fork. Toss in red bell pepper, jalapeno, 1/4 cup green onions, rice vinegar, 
                soy sauce, sesame oil, Sriracha, and lemon juice. Mix with a fork until thoroughly 
                combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off heat and let rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fluff rice with a fork to separate the grains and break up any large clumps; transfer 
                into the mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly with a spoon until all the ingredients are evenly 
                incorporated. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve warm, at room temperature, or 
                cold like a rice salad, topped with red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon green onion.
